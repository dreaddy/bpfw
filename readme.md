**Purpose of BPFW** 

BPFW (Business Process Framework) is a free framework to create web hosted business apps. This can be a customized ERP Software, a SaaS application, a prototype for your new startup, backoffice applications, a backend for your online game and much more.
If you have to manage data, BPFW is a good solution.

It is made to be easy and fast. In most cases, you can focus on just writing the business logic.
With going through the installer and writing a handful of code lines, you can create a reliable replacement for your Spreadsheets and index cards within a few hours.
But you can also create serious business apps with it and save a lot of time and money.

It is written in PHP, so you are not losing the flexibility of a real programming language and if your webspace runs your website, it can also run BPFW.

BPFW also features a lot of stuff out of the box:
PDF Creation, User and rights management, l18n, Flexible and nested CRUD lists and dialogues, backups, cronjobs, (mass-)mailer, easy code first database creation and update, import/export, three designs and a lot more.
